# Advanced ML project

This repository contains the code for the project of the course 'Advanced machine learning' taught by Austin Stromme for the 3rd year of ENSAE. This repository contains our own implementation of the method on different datasets as well as a tentative to use an existing sklearn method to achieve the desired goal. We chose the article 'Support Vector clustering' by Ben-Hur et al. published in 2001.

The folder 'data' contains the data from the 'Online News Popularity' of the UCI machine learning repository. The notebook 'first tests' is our implementation of the method on generated two dimensional data to help visualize what the procedure does. Both notebooks starting with 'application' contain the application of the SVM clustering procedure to different datasets. 

Lastly, the notebook 'try_sklearn' contains the tentative we made to apply sklearn's function OneClassSVM to different datasets to reproduce the desired results. 

In order to reproduce our results, it is sufficient to run each notebook, we made them independent so the order doesn't matter.
